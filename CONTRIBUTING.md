- **Load Balancing vs Token Burning** — Efficiency matters
- **Confidence Calibration vs Runaway Execution** — Quality over speed
- **Methodology-First vs Tool-First** — Process defines tools, not vice versa

## Component-Specific Guidelines

### North Star Blueprint

- Maintain platform-agnostic language
- Preserve existing section numbering (or coordinate renumbering)

- Include quality gates where appropriate

### Master Build Framework

The MBF contains technology options by category. When contributing:

- Add tools to appropriate categories (1-56+)
- Include: Tool name, type/provider, best use case
- Add cross-category dependencies where relevant
- Include agentic prompt hooks for complex categories

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap is the entry point. When contributing:

- Keep it beginner-friendly
- Maintain self-cleaning philosophy
- Test with fresh projects
- Preserve load-balancing behavior

### BRIDGE

BRIDGE handles routing. When contributing:

- Ensure routes map to correct sections/categories
- Test routing with real queries
