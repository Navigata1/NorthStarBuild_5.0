## What Is This?

North Star Framework is an **AI-native development methodology** that helps you build software projects from zero to deployment using AI agents as intelligent collaborators.

**Core Philosophy:**
- **Load what you need, unload when done** — No context window bloat
- **Pause when uncertain** — Confidence calibration prevents runaway errors
- **Process defines tools** — Methodology first, technology second

---

## Step 1: Choose Your Entry Point

### Option A: Fresh Project (Recommended)

Copy this prompt into your AI assistant:

```
Read this bootstrap file and help me start a new project:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[your-repo]/NORTH_STAR_BOOTSTRAP.md

My project: [describe your project in 1-2 sentences]
```

The Bootstrap will:
1. Ask clarifying questions about your project
2. Route you to the right methodology sections
3. Guide you through architecture decisions
4. Set up your documentation structure

### Option B: Existing Project

If you already have a project and want to improve it:

```
Read this routing guide and help me navigate to the right section:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[your-repo]/BRIDGE.md

I need help with: [describe your challenge]
```

## Step 2: Let the Framework Guide You

The framework operates in layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  YOU → BOOTSTRAP → BRIDGE → BLUEPRINT/MBF → IMPLEMENTATION                  │
│                                                                              │
│  1. You describe what you want to build                                      │
│  2. Bootstrap interviews you to understand requirements                      │
│  3. BRIDGE routes you to the right sections                                  │
│  4. Blueprint provides methodology (HOW)                                     │
│  5. MBF provides technology options (WHAT)                                   │
│  6. You implement with AI assistance                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**You don't need to read everything.** The framework fetches only what's relevant to your current task.

## Step 3: Understand the Components

| Component | Purpose | When You Need It |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| **Bootstrap** | Entry point and ignition | Starting any project |
| **BRIDGE** | Navigation and routing | Finding specific guidance |
| **Blueprint** | Methodology and process | Understanding HOW to build |
| **MBF** | Technology options | Choosing WHAT to build with |

### File Purposes

- `NORTH_STAR_BOOTSTRAP.md` — Start here. Always.
- `BRIDGE.md` — Navigation. Routes queries to correct sections.
- `NORTH_STAR_BLUEPRINT.md` — 59+ sections of methodology.
- `MASTER_BUILD_FRAMEWORK.md` — 56+ categories of technology options.
- `GLOBAL_IDE_RULES.md` — IDE-specific configurations (if needed).

---

## Step 4: Common Starting Paths

### "I want to build a web application"

```
Bootstrap → Requirements Interview → 
  Blueprint §4 (Vision Statement) → 
  Blueprint §37 (Architecture Selection) →
  MBF Category 1 (Web Apps) →
  Implementation
```

### "I want to build an AI/LLM application"

```
Bootstrap → Requirements Interview →
  Blueprint §37 (Architecture Selection) →
  MBF Category 29-35 (AI/ML Categories) →
  Blueprint §20-27 (Orchestration) →
  Implementation
```

### "I need to improve my testing"

```
BRIDGE → Quality Section →
  Blueprint §43-45 (Testing Strategy) →
  MBF Category 46 (Testing Frameworks) →
  Implementation
```

### "I need help with deployment"

```
BRIDGE → Deployment Section →
  Blueprint §50-53 (Deployment & Operations) →
  MBF Category 9-14 (Infrastructure) →
  Implementation
```

## Step 5: Best Practices

### Do

- ✅ Start with Bootstrap for new projects
- ✅ Let the framework guide your reading path
- ✅ Follow quality gates before moving forward
- ✅ Use handoff documents for session continuity
- ✅ Trust the load-balance philosophy

### Don't

- ❌ Try to read everything at once
- ❌ Skip the requirements interview
- ❌ Ignore quality gate warnings
- ❌ Rush past uncertainty flags

---

## Troubleshooting

### "The AI agent seems confused"

Try:
1. Use BRIDGE.md to get specific routing
2. Reference specific section numbers (e.g., "See Blueprint §37")
3. Ask the agent to summarize its current understanding

### "I'm hitting context limits"

The framework is designed for streaming:
1. Use handoff documents between sessions
2. Ask the agent to unload completed sections
3. Focus on one section at a time

### "I don't know which technology to choose"

MBF provides options, not mandates:
1. Look at the "Best For" column in each category
2. Consider your team's existing expertise
3. Start simple, optimize later

## Next Steps

1. **Read the Bootstrap** — It will guide everything else
2. **Describe your project** — Be specific about what you're building
3. **Follow the routing** — Let BRIDGE navigate you
4. **Build with confidence** — The framework has your back
