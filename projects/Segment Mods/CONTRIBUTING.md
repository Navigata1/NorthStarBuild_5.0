## ðŸŒŸ Our Philosophy

> "Build with intention. Ship with confidence."

We welcome contributions that align with our core principles:
- **Load Balancing vs Token Burning** â€” Efficiency matters
- **Confidence Calibration vs Runaway Execution** â€” Quality over speed
- **Methodology-First vs Tool-First** â€” Process defines tools, not vice versa
